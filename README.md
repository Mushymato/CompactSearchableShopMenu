# Compact Searchable Shop Menu

A compact and searchable shop menu.

## Inspirations

There are many shop menu mods out there and this mod is really just a combination of features I personally like, here are the direct inspirations:

- [Better Shop Menu](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2012): Grid menu.
- [Catalogue Filter](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/13137) - [Continued](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/22379): Search box position.
- [Shop Tabs](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/29435): Shop tabs.

## Installation

1. Download and install SMAPI.
2. Download this mod and install to the Mods folder.

## Configuration

- `Shop Item Per Row`: Number of items per row when a price must be displayed (e.g. regular shops).

- `Dresser Item Per Row`: Number of items per row when there are no prices (e.g. dressers, catalogues).

- `Stack Count on Shift+Ctrl`: Number of items to buy when using Shift+Ctrl (vanilla 25).

- `Enable Search and Filters`: Enable search box and category tabs (if not drawer).

## Compatible Mods

Any shops added through content patcher is compatible.

There are no custom UI elements used, so all interface recolor mods are compatible.

[Happy Home Designer](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/19675) implements a completely custom menu, so it takes precedence over this mod for catalogues (as it should).

## Incompatible Mods

Since this mod heavily modifies draw related logic on shop menu, it will be incompatible with any mod assuming the vanilla layout. Refer to pinned comment for up to date info about mods known to be incompatible.

### Gamepad

The grid menu works with gamepads, and you can use LeftShoulder and RightShoulder to switch between category tabs (not rebindable).

There's no way to snap to the search box yet, perhaps a future version.
